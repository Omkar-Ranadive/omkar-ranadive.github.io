I presented in the AI Journal Club on how abstract human concepts like Imagination and Curiosity are implemented in the context of Reinforcement Learning. The presentation was based on the following papers: 
<ul>
<li><strong>Imagination Augmented Agents:</strong> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06203" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06203</a></li>
<li><strong>Curiosity Driven Exploration:</strong> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05363" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05363</a></li>
<li><strong>Large Scale Study of Curiosity:</strong> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04355" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04355</a></li>
</ul>

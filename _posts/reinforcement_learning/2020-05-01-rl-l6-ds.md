**Why are function approximators required?**

Complex reinforcement learning problems like learning the game of Go
have huge state-space (10^170 for Go). Finding the exact value of all
such states is not computationally feasible. Hence, function
approximators are required to solve real-world, large scale problems.

One huge advantage of function approximators is that we **can generalize
from seen states to unseen states. That is, we don’t need to visit all
the states to estimate their values. Once we approximate a function well
enough, any state can be approximated well.**

**Types of function approximator:**

![](../images/rl/l6-ds/media/image2.png)

Function approximators may take only the state as input or the state
action pair (s, a) as input. Then we can output the state-value
function, action value or action values for all actions as shown above.

**Note – Here w = weight matrix**

**Different approximators:**

Neural networks and linear combinations of features are widely used as
**they are differentiable**.

Note that, in RL, the data is non-stationary; that is we are learning
while exploring the environment and it is also non-iid (iid =
independent and identical distributed); that is, the time sequence of
data matters.

**Incremental methods:**

**Basics of gradient descent:**

![](../images/rl/l6-ds/media/image5.png)

**Value function approximation using stochastic gradient descent:**

![](../images/rl/l6-ds/media/image6.png)

**Here, assume that the actual value v<sub>pi</sub>(S) is known to us.**
Then we are simply calculating the squared error between the predicted
value v\_cap and the actual known value.

**Feature vectors:**

![](../images/rl/l6-ds/media/image7.png)

A state can be represented using features. This is useful because we can
now pass features to the neural network to better approximate the value
function.

**Linear value function approximation:**

![](../images/rl/l6-ds/media/image8.png)

The value function can be represented as a linear combination of the
features x(S) and weight matrix w. (x(S)<sup>T</sup>\*W)

**Intuitive thinking:** By representing it in such a way, we can see
that the squared error will become quadratic in nature. Hence, the plot
of J(W) will be a quadratic curve. We know that quadratic functions have
a global optimum and hence, we can say that this algorithm will converge
to the global optimum.

**Table lookup:**

![](../images/rl/l6-ds/media/image9.png)

The case of table lookup can also be shown in the form of features.
**The feature vector in this case will have rows = number of states and
the ith entry will 1 if the current state is Si else it will be 0.**

**Note this is only to show the relationship between the previous table
lookup algorithm and current neural net implementation.**

**Incremental Prediction algorithm:**

![](../images/rl/l6-ds/media/image10.png)

Till now we assumed that Vpi(S) was known to us. But this won’t be the
case in reality. **Hence, we approximate it using return G<sub>t</sub>
for Monte Carlo and the usual TD estimate for TD. Similarly, the lambda
return G<sub>t</sub> is used for TD(lambda).**

**Why isn’t the derivative of v\_cap(S<sub>t+1</sub> , W) calculated in
TD(0)?**

The interesting thing is that in TD(0) the “actual” value Vpi is
estimated using R<sub>t+1</sub> + lambda\*V\_cap(S<sub>t+1</sub>, W).
**Here the V\_cap entry is the value spitted by the neural network
itself.** Hence, we are using the neural network’s approximation to
improve the neural network. This works over time as R<sub>t+1</sub> is
the actual reward. Hence, by updating it every time step, we slowly
bring it closer to the true estimate. But notice that we are ignoring
the derivative of V\_cap(S<sub>t+1</sub>, W) and only calculating for
V\_cap(S<sub>t</sub> , W). **This is because, we want to move forward.**
When we calculate the fastest rate of change from state S at time step
t, we get which direction to move forward in. At the same time if we
calculate for S at time step t+1, we would be kind of pulling it in both
directions.

**However, in some cases taking both derivatives may provide better
results.**

**Monte-Carlo with value-function approximation:**

![](../images/rl/l6-ds/media/image11.png)

Remember in Monte Carlo we first run through the entire episode. Hence,
we would collect tuples (S1, G1), (S2, G2)..(St, Gt) at the end of each
episode. Then these tuples can be used to perform an update in the right
direction. Hence, these tuples can be thought of as training data and
the problem reduces down to a supervised learning problem per episode.

**TD learning for value function approximation:**

![](../images/rl/l6-ds/media/image12.png)

In case of TD learning, we aren’t getting the actual rewards. It’s an
estimate hence, the training data will also be an estimate. **Also, the
update will be performed each time step.**

**TD(lambda) with value-function approximations:**

![](../images/rl/l6-ds/media/image13.png)

Notice that in Backward linear TD, the eligibility trace at time step t
is decaying trace at time step t-1 + **x(St). Here are consider the
features at step t. (for linear). Note this is basically, the gradient
of v\_cap(St, w) which in the case of linear combination decomposes to
x(St).**

**Control with value-function approximation:**

![](../images/rl/l6-ds/media/image14.png)

As we saw previously, action-value functions need to be used over
state-value functions in case of model-free environments. Hence, we
would instead approximate the action-value function in such cases.

![](../images/rl/l6-ds/media/image15.png)

**Linear action-value representation:**

![](../images/rl/l6-ds/media/image16.png)

**Incremental algorithms:**

![](../images/rl/l6-ds/media/image17.png)

**Bootstrapping:**

![](../images/rl/l6-ds/media/image18.png)

The graphs show that in most of the cases, bootstrapping (choosing TD
lambda with lambda between 0 and 1) is **usually a good idea.**

**Convergence of prediction algorithms:**

![](../images/rl/l6-ds/media/image19.png)

It’s important to understand which algorithm may not converge as in some
cases, the derivatives may shoot in the wrong direction and give
catastrophic results.

**Improvements: Gradient TD**

![](../images/rl/l6-ds/media/image20.png)

Remember that in TD, we took derivative of Rt+1 + lambda\*q\_cap(St+1,
a, W) where q\_cap was approximated by the neural network itself. Hence,
it didn’t follow the true gradient. Gradient TD solves this problem by
following the true gradient of projected Bellman error.

**Convergence of Control: (Note that control algorithms will optimal
solution)**

**Batch reinforcement learning:**

![](../images/rl/l6-ds/media/image22.png)

In incremental reinforcement learning we were using the (S, A) tuples
**only once.** After updating, we were throwing away that tuple.
Updating the gradient once is not enough to squeeze out all information
from the tuple.

**Example:** A game may have different levels. After starting level 2
which may be different from level 1, our agent will start losing
information of level 1 as it will be overshadowed and forgotten due to
the current incoming tuples of level 2.

![](../images/rl/l6-ds/media/image23.png)

This can be solved by using experience replay where we store all the
tuples and then choose a random sample from it at every time step.

![](../images/rl/l6-ds/media/image24.png)

**Experience replay also converges to least square solution.**

**Experience Replay in Deep Q-networks (DQN):**

![](../images/rl/l6-ds/media/image25.png)

State-of-art DQN use experience replay to solve the problem of
forgetting the previous tuples and squeezing the maximum information out
of each tuple by keeping the tuples in memory and sampling a batch from
them in every iteration. **This also helps mitigate extreme co-relation
of data.**

**Fixed Q-targets:**

The other improvement used is the fixed Q targets. This is like the off
policy learning of Q learning where we had two policies: behavior and
target. The q-value of state s’ was chosen from target policy while the
current action was chosen from the behavior policy.

**Similarly, here we keep a copy of the old q-learning targets. That is
there are two networks. Old DQN and the present DQN. After every n
iterations, say 1000 iterations, Old will be set to present.**

**But within those iterations the Q(s’, a’, w\_) will be chosen from the
old DQN. This helps stabilize the network.**

**Linear least square prediction:**

![](../images/rl/l6-ds/media/image26.png)

For fairly small problems (where the number of features are small), we
can instead use linear algebra to directly get the approximate values
instead of using a neural network.

![](../images/rl/l6-ds/media/image27.png)

As we can see, the w matrix is calculated by taking the matrix inverse
of the linear combination multiplied by the sum of X(s)\*Vt. **This only
works where N (features) are small.**

In practice:

![](../images/rl/l6-ds/media/image29.png)

Convergence:

![](../images/rl/l6-ds/media/image30.png)

**Hence, linear algorithms will lead to the global optimum.**

**Least square policy evaluation:**

![](../images/rl/l6-ds/media/image31.png)

We can use Q-learning with least squared error between the q values for
evaluating policies.

![](../images/rl/l6-ds/media/image32.png)

**Least square control:**

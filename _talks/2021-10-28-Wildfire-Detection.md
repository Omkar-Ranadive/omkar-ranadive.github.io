excerpt: "Wildfires are a huge problem in the state of California. In 2021 alone, there have been 7,000+ wildfires in California, which have burned down over 2 million acres of land. An automated system that detects wildfires early, before they spread, can help save lives and minimize damage to land and structures. In this talk, we will discuss Alchera's Wildfire Alert System, which uses machine learning to perform early detection of wildfires. The system analyzes images in real-time from over 800 cameras and sends immediate alerts to users. "

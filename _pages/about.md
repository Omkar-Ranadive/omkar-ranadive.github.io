I am currently working as an Applied Scientist at [Alchera Labs](https://alcherainc.com/en/){:target="_blank"}. My areas of research include Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning. 

My overarching goal is to develop AI algorithms which would bring us closer to attaining general intelligence. My other goal is to incorporate AI into different disciplines of science. I have always been enthralled by Computer Science as it is one of the few fields where practical results can be achieved quickly. I believe that by amalgamating AI with Computer Science,  people from all disciplines will be able to satisfy their curiosity, get practical results, perform better research and solve problems faster. 

I did my Master's in Computer Science from [Northwestern University](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/){:target="_blank"} and my Bachelor's (B.Tech) in Computer Engineering from [K.J Somaiya College of Engineering](https://kjsce.somaiya.edu/kjsce/){:target="_blank"}. 

Other than science, I am an avid foodie and I love trying out new dishes. I also love to travel and explore, read manga and watch tv-series/anime.

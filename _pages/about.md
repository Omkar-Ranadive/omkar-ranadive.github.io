I am a Computer Science graduate student at [Northwestern University](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/){:target="_blank"}. My areas of research include Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning. 

My goal is to make AI a tool which would be accessible to people of every discipline. I have always been enthralled by Computer Science as it is one of the few fields where practical results can be achieved quickly. I believe that by amalgamating AI with Computer Science,  people from all disciplines will be able to satisfy their curiosity, get practical results, perform better research and solve problems faster. 

I have completed my Bachelors in Technology (B.Tech) in Computer Engineering from [K.J Somaiya College of Engineering](https://kjsce.somaiya.edu/kjsce/){:target="_blank"}. My final year project was titled "Simulation Environment for Development and Testing of Autonomous Learning Agents". You can check out the paper over [here.](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3367735){:target="_blank"}

Other than technology, I am an avid foodie and I love trying out new dishes. I also love travelling, reading manga and watching tv series and anime.

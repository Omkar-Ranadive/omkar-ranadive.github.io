------
I am currently working as a Research Specialist at [NU Earth](https://www.earth.northwestern.edu/){:target="_blank"}. Previously, I have worked as an Applied Scientist at [Alchera Labs](https://alcherainc.com/en/){:target="_blank"}, and as a Researcher at [CIERA](https://ciera.northwestern.edu/){:target="_blank"}. 

My research interests lie broadly in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Reinforcement Learning. More specifically, my primary research interest is in understanding the underlying behavior and function of neural networks through empirical experiments and foundational theory, and using this knowledge to develop more intelligent systems. Additionally, I am also interested in integrating machine learning algorithms into the scientific development process across various disciplines such that it would help expedite the pace of scientific research.

I completed my M.S. in Computer Science from [Northwestern University](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/){:target="_blank"} and my B.Tech. in Computer Engineering from [K.J Somaiya College of Engineering](https://kjsce.somaiya.edu/kjsce/){:target="_blank"}. 

In my free time, I love to try out new dishes and restaurants, play tennis, read manga/manhwa, and travel/explore new places (Check out my [travel map](#travel-map)).  

My CV can be found [here.](../files/CV.pdf){:target="_blank"} Please drop me an email if you have any questions related to my research or if you are interested in a research collaboration.

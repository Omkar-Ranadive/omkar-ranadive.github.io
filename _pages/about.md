I am currently working as a Research Specialist at [NU Earth](https://www.earth.northwestern.edu/){:target="_blank"}. Previously, I have worked as an Applied Scientist at [Alchera Labs](https://alcherainc.com/en/){:target="_blank"} and as a Researcher at [CIERA](https://ciera.northwestern.edu/){:target="_blank"}. My research interests lie broadly in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Reinforcement Learning. More specifically, I am most interested in understanding the “why” behind neural networks and its processes and using this knowledge to develop more intelligent algorithms. My second goal is to incorporate AI algorithms into different disciplines of science so that people from different disciplines can solve problems faster and expedite the scientific research process. 

I did my Master's in Computer Science from [Northwestern University](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/){:target="_blank"} and my Bachelor's (B.Tech) in Computer Engineering from [K.J Somaiya College of Engineering](https://kjsce.somaiya.edu/kjsce/){:target="_blank"}. 

In my free time, I love to try out new dishes and restaurants, play tennis, read manga, and travel/explore new places.  

My CV can be found [here.](../files/CV.pdf){:target="_blank"} Please drop me an email if you have any questions related to my research or if you are interested in a research collaboration.

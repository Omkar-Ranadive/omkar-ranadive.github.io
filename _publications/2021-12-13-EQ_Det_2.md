excerpt: 'Study of dynamically triggered earthquakes and tremors allows a more comprehensive understanding of how faults evolve and the temporal conditions under which transient stresses may activate them. In this citizen science project, we asked volunteer scientists to identify earthquakes and tremors in Alaska and the Western US that could have been dynamically triggered. The project is called Earthquake Detective and is hosted on zooniverse.org. After a brief training module, users view graphs and listen to relevant sections of seismograms, accelerated to audible frequencies, and classify signals in four ways: earthquake, tremor, noise, and null. Over 6000 volunteer scientists have made 130,000 classifications after listening to and viewing relevant, filtered sections of seismic recordings of Mw>7.5 earthquakes spanning the years 2012-2018. We find 12 potentially triggered earthquakes in Alaska and 4 earthquakes in the Western US, while classification of tremors was quite rare, and we identify one in southcentral Alaska. Engaging citizen scientists in this type of experiment has many advantages: 1) we exploit the ability of the human ear to implicitly perform a spectrogram (time-frequency analysis) capable of discerning a wide range of different signals; 2) multiple human ears listening to the same signal provides redundancy of observations and therefore statistical analysis can be performed on the classifications; 3) a blind volunteer is positioned to perform and contribute at least as well as a seeing volunteer; 4) the project enhances informal learning because the online platform, Zooniverse, is available to persons of all identities, ages, cultural backgrounds, and education level; 5) the Comments section of our project on Zooniverse can be mined for keywords, FAQ, and tracking user and expert dialogue for learning patterns and communication styles to both refine and inform improvements to our outreach strategies. We present our results from Earthquake Detective to date and share plans to extend its use to classify small, local seismic events on faults of interest in and around the San Francisco Bay Area by recruiting local high school and undergraduate students to be our citizen scientists thereby providing them the experience of scientific research.'

excerpt: "Seismic data in urban environments are dominated by man-made noise sources (e.g. traffic, construction, quarry blasts), which can falsely trigger earthquake detection algorithms and reduce the signal-to-noise ratios of desired signals. Despite (or rather due to) these challenges, investigating urban seismic noise has led to developments in earthquake detection, environmental monitoring, and passive source imaging. In this study, we analyze 5+ years of seismic data from a broadband station in the Chicago area, uniquely located within a 10-km radius of a limestone quarry, a flood-control reservoir, major highways, dense residential districts, and an international airport. We aim to create a labeled dataset of Chicago noise that can be used to refine, train, and test algorithms for earthquake detection and denoising.
To detect nonstationary signals in the Chicago area, we first applied a power spectral density (PSD) misfit detector to our multi-year station data. We then developed and applied an unsupervised learning model (K means clustering) to our nonstationary signals, with the aim of clustering events with similar waveforms and potentially a similar source. Features of our clustering model include cross-correlation values of select waveform templates, PSD misfits, and other statistical metrics. We will describe the development of our model and present some unique clusters and events. By analyzing temporal trends, we will discuss possible sources (e.g. highway traffic, aircraft signals) of repeating events and their potential for applications in monitoring and imaging.

excerpt: 'We present the Earthquake Detective dataset - A crowdsourced set of labels on potentially triggered (PT) earthquakes and tremors. These events are those which may have been triggered by large magnitude and often distant earthquakes. We apply Machine Learning to classify these PT seismic events and explore the challenges faced in segregating such low amplitude signals. The data set and code are available online.'

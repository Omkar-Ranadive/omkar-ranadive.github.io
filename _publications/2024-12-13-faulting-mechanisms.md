excerpt: "Signed amplitudes (amplitudes and polarities) of seismic body waves recorded by a single, three-component seismometer can constrain the strike, dip, and rake of a sudden shear dislocation within the Earth, i.e. an earthquake with a double-couple faulting mechanism. Ever since this possibility was recognized over four decades ago, seismologists have used body wave amplitude ratios to constrain or help constrain earthquake faulting mechanisms via a grid search. However, such ratios become unstable when one of the body waves leaves the source along a nodal plane of the faulting mechanismâ€™s radiation pattern, which is not uncommon. We introduce a robust method for using relative, signed P, SV, and SH wave amplitudes from a single seismogram to precisely estimate faulting mechanisms and their uncertainties. We present results of applying the method to 1) a subset of low-frequency marsquakes recorded by the single broadband seismometer installed by the InSight mission, and 2) a set of small-magnitude earthquakes along the East-African Rift recorded by at least one regional seismometer.
Our findings from analyzing this subset of marsquakes suggest that their inferred faulting mechanisms are diverse and that some events might be doublets. We hypothesized that the common cause of such diverse quakes is migration of dense magma within the martian lithosphere, e.g. as associated with dike and sill emplacement. These findings are consistent with contemporaneous analyses of martian seismicity by the InSight team as well as with independent inferences of a mantle plume beneath the lithosphere in the general area.

The new method generally constrains one principal axis of the corresponding moment tensor well and leaves a degree of freedom for the rotation for the other two axes. Our method finds the optimal faulting mechanism either with a traditional grid search or with a faster and more precise non-linear gradient-descent search algorithm."

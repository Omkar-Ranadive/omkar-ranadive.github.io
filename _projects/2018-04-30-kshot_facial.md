description: "Developed a k-Shot Facial Recognition System which uses a combination of Dlib, Residual Neural Network and a Fully Connected network to learn from a small number of samples. The system produces a 100% accuracy with training samples per subject as small as 3, as long as the output classes are limited to a small number.
